# Summary

UD Treebank for uzbek language

# Introduction

UD_Uzbek-UzUDT is a manually annotated Universal Dependencies treebank for Uzbek. The initial release will include news and Wikipedia text with tokenization, UPOS, morphological features, lemmas, and basic dependency trees following the UD v2 guidelines. Annotation is performed by native-speaker linguists with expert review and validation using the UD tools. The goal is to provide a reliable resource for research on Uzbek NLP (tagging, parsing, morphology) and cross-lingual studies in low-resource settings. Future releases will expand coverage, refine guidelines, and include enhanced dependencies.
