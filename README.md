# Summary

UD Treebank for uzbek language

# Introduction

UD_Uzbek-UzUDT is a manually annotated Universal Dependencies treebank for Uzbek.  UPOS, morphological features, lemmas, and basic dependency trees following the UD v2 guidelines. Annotation is performed by native-speaker linguists with expert review and validation using the UD tools. The goal is to provide a reliable resource for research on Uzbek NLP (tagging, parsing, morphology) and cross-lingual studies in low-resource settings. Future releases will expand coverage, refine guidelines, and include enhanced dependencies.
new Universal Dependencies (UD) treebank for Uzbek language developed as a gold-standard resource with full manual annotations. The treebank includes 686 sentences (approximately 7,800 tokens) from Uzbek literature and educational writing – larger and domain-differentially richer than the current Uzbek UD treebank. The data were annotated using the INCEpCTION platform by six annotators (four linguists and two NLP engineers) with extensive cross-verification and adjudication to maintain high quality. Inter-annotator agreement exceeds 95\% for lemmatising, ~95\% for part-of-speech tagging, and ~90\% for morphological features (Cohen’s Kappa, Krippendorff’s Alpha).
